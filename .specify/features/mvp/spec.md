**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2025-10-24  
**Status:** Approved  
**Target:** Soul AI Contest - Initial Round

---

## Constitution Alignment

**Primary Principles Applied:**
- **Generation-First (P1)**: Complete generation workflow without chat features
- **Emotional Authenticity (P2)**: Deep psychological interview questions
- **Visual Excellence (P3)**: High aesthetic standards for UI and generated content
- **Performance (P5)**: <30s personality generation, <60s image generation
- **Simplicity (P6)**: MVP scope focused on core generation workflow
- **Cultural Appropriateness (P7)**: Chinese-first language and cultural context

**Potential Conflicts:** None - MVP scope strictly adheres to all principles

## Overview

### Purpose
Echo MVP delivers the core "Soul Resonance Generator" experience: users complete a psychological interview, and the system generates a complete AI persona with personality description and visual representation. This is a **generation-focused product**, NOT a chatbot.

### Context
This is the initial release (Week 1-2 development) for Soul AI Innovation Contest. The MVP demonstrates the complete generation workflow while excluding advanced features like video generation, user accounts, and conversation capabilities.

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing (MVP Scope)

**Critical Paths:**
1. Complete interview → Generate personality → Generate images → View profile → Share
2. Regenerate personality (keep answers)
3. Regenerate images (keep personality)
4. Error recovery (API failure scenarios)

**Cross-Browser:**
- Chrome (primary)
- Safari (iOS)
- WeChat built-in browser

**Device Testing:**
- iPhone (375px, 390px, 428px)
- Android (360px, 393px)
- Desktop (1280px, 1920px)

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path:** User completes all steps successfully
2. **Early Exit:** User leaves during interview (session preserved)
3. **API Failure:** LLM or image API returns error (retry logic)
4. **Slow Network:** 3G connection simulation
5. **Invalid Input:** Empty answers, special characters
6. **Regeneration:** Multiple regeneration cycles
