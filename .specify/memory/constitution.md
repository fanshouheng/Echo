# Echo Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Last Amended Date:** 2025-10-24

---

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the foundational principles, non-negotiable constraints, and governance framework for **Echo: AI灵魂共鸣体生成器** (Echo: AI Soul Resonance Generator). All design decisions, technical implementations, feature additions, and product changes MUST align with these principles.

Echo is a **generation-focused product**, NOT a chatbot. Our mission is to help users explore their inner emotional landscape through AI-powered personality synthesis and multi-modal content generation.

---

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Generation-First, Not Conversation

**Declaration:**
Echo MUST be a **creation tool**, not a conversation tool. All features MUST support the generation workflow (Interview → Analysis → Generation → Presentation → Share), and the product MUST NOT include ongoing chat/dialogue capabilities with generated personas.

**Rationale:**
- Differentiates Echo from saturated AI chatbot market
- Focuses user experience on tangible output (personality profiles, images, videos)
- Concentrates development resources on generation quality over chat maintenance
- Avoids emotional dependency patterns common in AI companion products
- Positions Echo as a creative/introspective tool rather than a replacement for human connection

**Implementation Requirements:**
- No persistent chat history storage beyond the initial interview
- No "continue conversation" features with generated Echo personas
- All user interactions culminate in a shareable artifact (profile, image, video)
- Marketing and UX copy must emphasize "create" not "chat"

---

### Principle 2: Emotional Authenticity Through Deep Understanding

**Declaration:**
Interview questions MUST be psychologically meaningful, emotionally resonant, and designed to reveal genuine user values rather than collect superficial preferences. Generated personas MUST reflect nuanced understanding, not stereotypes.

**Rationale:**
- Quality of output depends on quality of input
- Users seek self-discovery, not entertainment
- Authentic emotional mapping creates shareable value
- Depth differentiates Echo from simple "character generators"

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Interview questions reviewed for psychological validity
- Minimum 10 questions covering: emotional preferences, communication styles, values, aesthetic sensibilities
- LLM prompts engineered to extract meaning from indirect/ambiguous user responses
- Generated personality profiles must include specific examples and unique traits, not generic descriptions
- A/B test questions for emotional resonance and completion rates

---

### Principle 3: Visual and Aesthetic Excellence

**Declaration:**
All visual outputs (UI, generated images, videos, share cards) MUST meet high aesthetic standards. Echo is as much a visual experience as a psychological one.

**Rationale:**
- Visual quality determines shareability
- Aesthetic excellence communicates product value
- Soul platform users expect design sophistication
- First impression quality affects competition success

**Implementation Requirements:**
- UI follows defined design system (colors, typography, animations in PRD Section 9)
- Generated images undergo quality checks before presentation to users
- Share cards designed by professionals or using established templates
- Loading states and transitions are smooth and intentional
- Responsive design tested on mobile (primary platform for Soul users)
- Dark mode as default with optional light theme

---

### Principle 4: Privacy, Security, and Ethical Data Handling

**Declaration:**
User emotional data is sensitive. Echo MUST protect interview responses, generated profiles, and usage patterns with encryption, access controls, and transparent data policies. Users MUST have full control over their data.

**Rationale:**
- Interview responses reveal deep personal information
- Trust is prerequisite for authentic user engagement
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA if applicable)
- Ethical responsibility for psychological data

**Implementation Requirements:**
- User data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Clear privacy policy displayed before interview begins
- Users can delete all generated Echos and associated data
- No sharing of individual user data with third parties without explicit consent
- API keys and sensitive credentials stored in environment variables, never committed to repo
- Content moderation to prevent generation of harmful/inappropriate personas

---

### Principle 5: Performance and Reliability

**Declaration:**
Generation times MUST be optimized, error handling MUST be graceful, and the user experience MUST feel responsive even during computationally expensive operations.

**Rationale:**
- Long wait times cause abandonment
- Errors during emotional exercises damage trust
- Competition environment demands polish
- API costs correlate with retry frequency

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Personality generation: 15-30 seconds maximum
- Image generation: 30-60 seconds maximum
- Video generation: 60-120 seconds maximum (optional feature)
- Loading screens display progress indicators and engaging messages
- Automatic retry logic for transient API failures (max 3 retries)
- Fallback mechanisms: if premium API fails, attempt backup provider
- Performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Error messages are empathetic, not technical (e.g., "正在重新构思..." not "API Error 500")

---

### Principle 6: Simplicity and Focus

**Declaration:**
Echo MUST do one thing exceptionally well: generate meaningful AI personas. Feature creep MUST be resisted. New features MUST directly serve the core generation workflow.

**Rationale:**
- MVP must ship within 2-week timeline
- Complexity dilutes user experience
- Competition judges value polish over feature count
- Maintenance burden increases with feature count

**Implementation Requirements:**
- New feature proposals evaluated against: Does this improve generation quality OR shareability?
- MVP excludes: user accounts, video generation, persona editing, chat features
- V1.1+ features documented in roadmap but not blocking initial release
- Code reviews reject scope creep
- Each page/component serves a single clear purpose

---

### Principle 7: Cultural and Linguistic Appropriateness

**Declaration:**
Echo targets Chinese-speaking Soul platform users. All content, UX copy, and generated personalities MUST be culturally appropriate and linguistically natural for this audience.

**Rationale:**
- Soul platform is Chinese-language
- Direct translation creates awkward experiences
- Cultural references and emotional expressions differ across languages
- Competition judges are Chinese-speaking

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Primary language: Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
- Interview questions written by native speakers or culturally reviewed
- LLM prompts generate Chinese-language personality descriptions
- UI copy avoids direct English translations, uses natural phrasing
- Generated personas reference culturally relevant scenarios (e.g., 清晨阳光, not "morning coffee")
- Share cards designed for WeChat/Soul sharing contexts

---

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal:** Any team member can propose an amendment by documenting:
   - Principle affected or new principle to add
   - Rationale for change
   - Impact analysis on existing features

2. **Review:** Proposal reviewed for:
   - Alignment with project mission
   - Feasibility given timeline/resources
   - Consistency with other principles

3. **Adoption:** Amendments adopted by project lead decision (for solo development) or team consensus (if team expands)

4. **Documentation:** Amendments trigger version bump and update to Sync Impact Report

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Removal or fundamental redefinition of existing principles
- **MINOR (0.X.0):** Addition of new principles or significant expansion of existing ones
- **PATCH (0.0.X):** Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes

### Compliance Review

- **Pre-Development:** Review constitution before starting new features
- **Code Review:** Pull requests checked for principle violations
- **Pre-Release:** Final compliance check before deployment
- **Post-Release:** User feedback analyzed for principle misalignment

### Conflict Resolution

If two principles conflict in a specific situation:
1. Prioritize **Principle 1** (Generation-First) and **Principle 4** (Privacy) as foundational
2. Document the conflict and resolution rationale
3. Consider amendment if conflicts recur
